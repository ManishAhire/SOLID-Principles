## Introduction

The SOLID principles represent a set of design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software. This repository aims to illustrate how these principles can be applied in iOS development using Swift, providing clear examples and best practices.

## Single-responsibility Principle (S)

Explore the Single-responsibility Principle, which advocates that a class should have only one reason to change. Learn how to design classes with a single responsibility, making them more modular and easier to maintain.

## Open-closed Principle (O)

Dive into the Open-closed Principle, emphasizing that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. Discover how to design systems that can be easily extended without altering existing code.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (L)

Understand the Liskov Substitution Principle, which states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. Learn how to create hierarchies that maintain consistency and integrity.

## Interface Segregation Principle (I)

Explore the Interface Segregation Principle, suggesting that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. Learn how to create lean and focused interfaces that improve code maintainability.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (D)

Dive into the Dependency Inversion Principle, advocating that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but rather both should depend on abstractions. Learn how to create flexible and decoupled systems by inverting the direction of dependencies.

## How to Use This Repository

Each SOLID principle is accompanied by practical examples, Swift code snippets, and explanations to help you understand and implement these principles in your iOS projects. Feel free to explore the folders and files in this repository to gain a deeper understanding of SOLID principles.
